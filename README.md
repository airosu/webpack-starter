# webpack-starter

This is a project starter using the webpack module bundler. It is configured with all base plugins needed to fully export from the 'src' folder to a distribution folder, named 'dist' by default. The src folder of this project contains a couple of demo files that you might want to delete / replace: 'src/js/sayHello.js', 'src/scss/test'.

### Installation

```
npm install
```
Will install all dev dependencies from package.json into 'node_modules'
